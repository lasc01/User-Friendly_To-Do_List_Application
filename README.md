# User-Friendly_To-Do_List_Application
As a young Nigerian guy attempting to meet basic requirements and ensure a better future for myself, I engage in a variety of activities. From teaching to online digital skill learning to performing in shows, and so on. Because I have so many events planned, I am bound to forget about some of them. I assumed that with the help of a to-do list software, I could effortlessly organize and manage my daily tasks. As a result, I embarked on this endeavor to create a to-do list that will assist me in efficiently managing and arranging my activities.

Its primary goal is to create a simple and easy-to-use platform for creating, managing, and prioritizing to-do items, allowing users to stay productive and focused on their objectives. In one month, I completed both the frontend and backend of the project by myself.

This to-do list software can help entrepreneurs, executives, project managers, and freelancers manage their work-related activities, deadlines, and projects more successfully.
